## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: 
Some challenges I encountered when building the app was mainly the Youtube section of the stretch features. I tried for several hours
to figure it out, but because of my emulator and Android Studio crashing, as well as trying to navigate between the files, I wasn't able to fully
complete it. For the Youtube trailer feature, I think the main thing stopping me was a lot of the syntax elements with the URL and layouts, which I ran
out of time to complete. However, I do feel like I was pretty close with that last stretch feature, so I just commented my code out for that and I'm definitely going to finish 
it up later. I also had some challenges with some of the layouts and making sure all of the features worked correctly, but I eventually
figured those out.
